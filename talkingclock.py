Code Clash #18 - Talking Clock (talkingclock.py)


Author: Andrew Scott White

Difficulty Level: 8/10

Prompt: I don’t want to be late for the BWSI Grand Prix, so I want
to program my phone to update me on the time. Can you help me make 
a Talking Clock? I need a script that takes an input 24-hour time 
(00:00 - 23:59) and translates it into words. Please format the input 
as ‘##:##’ and include am/pm in the output string. Thanks!

Test Cases:
Input: 12:00  Output: It's twelve pm

Input: 23:59  Output: It's eleven fifty nine pm

Input: 12:05  Output: It's twelve oh five pm
